On the food guide, Now lets assume that I chose the following options:

{selected_options}

What 1-5 questions do you need me to answer in order to give me exactly the output I desire?
Provide the questions in a JSON format with a list of objects, each object having "question" and "description" fields.
For example:
```json
{
  "questions": [
    {
      "question": "What is your current daily caloric intake?",
      "description": "This helps determine how many more calories are needed to achieve a caloric surplus."
    },
    {
      "question": "How many meals per day are you currently eating?",
      "description": "This helps in adjusting the number of meals and their distribution across the day."
    }
  ]
}
